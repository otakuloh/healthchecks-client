## Installation

To get started, download the latest release of the Healthchecks Client from the [Releases section](https://github.com/otakuloh/healthchecks-client/releases). Once downloaded, execute the binary file to start monitoring your endpoints.

### Download Instructions

1. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/otakuloh/healthchecks-client/releases).
2. Choose the appropriate binary for your operating system.
3. Download the file.
4. Make the binary executable (if necessary).
5. Run the binary to begin.

## Usage

Using the Healthchecks Client is straightforward. After downloading and executing the binary, you can start monitoring your HTTP endpoints. Here‚Äôs a basic example:

```bash
./healthchecks-client --url https://your-endpoint.com --interval 60
```

In this command:
- `--url` specifies the HTTP endpoint you want to monitor.
- `--interval` sets the monitoring interval in seconds.

### Command-Line Options

- `--url`: The URL of the HTTP endpoint to monitor.
- `--interval`: Time in seconds between health checks.
- `--timeout`: Time in seconds to wait for a response before considering the check a failure.
- `--failure-threshold`: Number of consecutive failures before triggering an alert.
- `--success-threshold`: Number of consecutive successes before resuming normal operation.

## Configuration

The Healthchecks Client allows for flexible configuration. You can create a configuration file to manage your settings. Here‚Äôs an example configuration file:

```yaml
url: https://your-endpoint.com
interval: 60
timeout: 5
failure_threshold: 3
success_threshold: 2
```

Save this file as `config.yaml` and run the client with:

```bash
./healthchecks-client --config config.yaml
```

## Monitoring HTTP Endpoints

Monitoring HTTP endpoints is essential for ensuring that your services are operational. The Healthchecks Client can monitor various types of endpoints, including REST APIs, web services, and more.

### Example Use Cases

1. **Web Application Monitoring**: Ensure your web application is accessible and responsive.
2. **API Monitoring**: Monitor RESTful APIs for uptime and performance.
3. **Microservices Health Checks**: Keep track of the health of individual microservices in your architecture.

## Alerting

The Healthchecks Client supports alerting features that notify you of service failures. You can set thresholds for both failures and successes, allowing you to receive alerts only when necessary.

### Setting Up Alerts

To set up alerts, configure the `failure-threshold` and `success-threshold` options in your configuration file. This way, you can avoid unnecessary notifications and focus on critical issues.
